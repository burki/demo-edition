Installation Notes
------------------
Requirements
- PHP 7.3 or 7.4 (check with `php -v`)
  PHP 8 doesn't work (due to "solarium/solarium": "^5.1")
- composer (check with `composer -v`; if it is missing, see https://getcomposer.org/)
- MySQL or MariaDB (for metadata storage)
- Java 1.8 (for XSLT and Solr, check with `java -version`)
- `convert` (for image tiles, check with `which convert`; if it is missing, install e.g. with `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`)

In a fitting directory (e.g. `/var/www`), clone the project

    git clone https://github.com/igdj/demo-edition.git

If you don't have `git` installed, you can also download the project as ZIP-file
and extract it manually.

Change into the newly created project-directory

    cd demo-edition

Install dependencies

    composer install

Create database

    mysqladmin -u root -p create demo_edition

and create a database user with proper rights, e.g.

    mysql -u root -p demo_edition

Create a user and grant the needed privileges

    CREATE USER 'demo_edition'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD';
    GRANT ALL ON demo_edition.* TO 'demo_edition'@'localhost';

Create your local settings

    cp config/parameters.yaml-dist config/parameters.yaml

In `config/parameters.yaml`, adjust the database settings as by the
database, user and password set above:
    `database.name` / `database.user` / `database.password`)

Make `bin/console` executable

    chmod u+x ./bin/console

Alternatively, you can prepend to `./bin/console` in what follows

    php ./bin/console help

Create the database tables

    ./bin/console doctrine:schema:create

### XSLT-Processor
If you don't have Saxon/C (https://www.saxonica.com/saxon-c/index.xml)
installed as a PHP-module in your web server (which is quite tricky),
you can use the command line adapter.

For this, download `saxon9he.jar` as part of `SaxonHE9-9-1-8J.zip`
(or newer) from
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/9.9/
and place it in the `bin/` folder (next to `console`) and make sure
the path to the `java` binary is properly set in the following
line in `parameters.yaml`:

    app.xslt.adapter.arguments: "/usr/bin/java -jar %kernel.project_dir%/bin/saxon9he.jar -s:%%source%% -xsl:%%xsl%%  %%additional%%"

On Windows, it might look like

    app.xslt.adapter.arguments: "c:\\Run\\Java\\jdk1.8\\bin\\java -jar %kernel.project_dir%\\bin\\saxon9he.jar -s:%%source%% -xsl:%%xsl%% %%additional%%"

depending on your local Java installation.

### Solr Setup
You can skip this installation in the first step. Everything except the
search field should still work.

First, download

    https://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/6.2.0/solr-6.2.0.zip

and extract the contents of `solr-6.2.0` into the existing `solr/` folder.

Start solr by

    ./solr/bin/solr start

and then create the `demo_de` core

    ./solr/bin/solr create -c demo_de

You can clear the core and re-index existing entities

    ./bin/console solr:index:clear

    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Person"
    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Organization"
    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Place"
    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Bibitem"
    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Event"
    ./bin/console solr:index:populate "TeiEditionBundle\\Entity\\Article"

For trouble-shooting, you can access the Solr admin interface at

    http://localhost:8983/solr/

To stop it again, call

    ./solr/bin/solr stop -all

### Setup Web-Server
For testing purposes, you can use the built-in server from PHP

    php -S localhost:8000 -t web

And then navigate to http://localhost:8000/index.php/

If you are running on a different host than `localhost`, make sure to adjust

    jms_i18n_routing.hosts.de:  localhost

in `config/parameters.yaml` accordingly.

In order to point a proper Web-Server (apache or nginx) to `web`, see
    https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/web_server_configuration.html for
further detailed instruction.

Make sure to copy `.htaccess.dist` to `.htaccess` if you want to run the site
without prepnding `/index.php/` to every url.

If you get errors due to var not being writable, adjust directory permissions as
described in https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/setup/file_permissions.html
- sudo setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwX /path/to/var
- sudo setfacl -dR -m u:www-data:rwX /path/to/var

If you get errors due to web/css not being writable, adjust directory permissions as
described in https://symfony.com/doc/3.4/setup/file_permissions.html
- sudo setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwX /path/to/web/css
- sudo setfacl -dR -m u:www-data:rwX /path/to/web/css

### Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues, please contact us:

We are looking forward to work this through step by step or provide you
with a preconfigured VirtualBox.

Adding and updating Content
---------------------------
TEI files and page facsimiles are located in `sites/demo-edition/data` in the
corresponding `tei` or `img/source-xxxxx` folders.

Follow the following commands to add the first source to the site:

Add the author (Franz Kafka, by GND 118559230) to the `Person` table:

    ./bin/console article:author --insert-missing sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

You should now see it at

    http://localhost:8000/index.php/person

Add the source

    ./bin/console article:header --insert-missing sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

Refresh the source (this will fetch every persName / orgName / placeName with GND or TGN identifier)

    ./bin/console article:refresh sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

If we have a source with page facsimile as hinted by

    <classCode scheme="http://juedische-geschichte-online.net/doku/#genre">Quelle:Text</classCode>

We can now generate the tiles

    ./bin/console source:tiles sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

(`convert` from the ImageMagick packaged is called to generate the tiles in `web/viewer/source-00001/`)

And generate the METS-container needed for `iview`

    ./bin/console source:mets sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml > web/viewer/source-00001/source-00001.de.mets.xml

You can now preview the source at

    http://localhost:8000/index.php/quelle/source-1

If you make changes, you can update all the metadata by running again

    ./bin/console article:refresh sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

If you are happy with the display, you can publish it:

    ./bin/console article:header --publish sites/demo-site/data/tei/source-00001.de.xml

It should now show up on the timeline and connected to the author.

Tweaking the site
-----------------
### Translate messages and routes

    ./bin/console translation:extract de --dir=./src/ --dir=vendor/igdj/tei-edition-bundle --output-dir=./translations --enable-extractor=jms_i18n_routing

Theme-specific translations (TODO: add --intl-icu as soon as https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSTranslationBundle/pull/551 is merged)

    ./bin/console translation:extract de --dir=./sites/demo-site/templates --output-dir=./sites/demo-site/translations

### Font
We use Noto Serif as Brotschrift (book_typeface)
    https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif

The CSS-Settings are made in `assets/scss/font-definition.scss` as by the
`importPaths` in `scssphp`-settings in `config/config.yaml`.

For PDF-Generation, `app.pdf-generator.arguments` in `config/services.yaml` point
to the font files used.
